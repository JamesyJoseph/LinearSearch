# Linear Search
<p>The program implements a Linear Search algorithm to find a specific element in an array. 
  <ul><li>It prompts the user to input the array size and elements, then asks for the element to search.</li> 
  <li>The program checks each element sequentially and prints the position if the element is found.</li>
  <li>If the element is not found, it outputs a message indicating not found.</li></ul>
  The program uses a flag variable to track whether the item was found during the search.</p>
